# Home Credit Default Risk with Pytorch Lightning
Access to loans is crucial for financial inclusion, but many individual
with insufficient or non-existent credit histories are vulnerable to 
predatory lenders. Home Credit, a global non-bank finance provider founded in 1997, is committed to expanding financial inclusion by transforming the lending landscape. By leveraging innovative alternative data sources like telco and transactional information, Home Credit empowers the unbanked to achieve their financial goals safely and positively, using predictive analysis to match clients with loans that suit their repayment abilities and avoid the pitfalls of predatory lending. To achieve this vision, Home Credit launched a Kaggle competition to develop a successful predictive model based on diverse data points such as credit and cash transactions, demographics, and past applications.

For this project, we will explore datasets, use automatic feature engineering tools like featuretools to create new features, and experiment with an advanced neural network algorithms, Pytorch Lightning.
